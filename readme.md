# SscVolumeControl

This app is for propagating the volume settings of your Android TV to your SSC controllable speakers 
(e.g. Neumann KH 80 DSP, KH 120-II, KH-150).
This comes in handy, if you connected your speakers using SPDIF.
In that case, changing the volume of your TV does not affect the volume of your speakers, 
as the SPDIF signal is digital and does not contain volume information.
This app solves this problem by sending the volume changes of your TV to your speakers using the SSC protocol.
